### **2. Attendance vs Exam Scores**
**Test Type:** Linear Regression  
**Model:** `Exam_Score = 51.58 + 0.196(Attendance)`  
- **R²:** 0.338  
- **t-Statistic:** 58.03  
- **p-value:** < 0.001  

**Interpretation:**  
Attendance shows a **very strong positive effect** on exam scores, explaining **33.8% of score variability**.  
✅ **Conclusion:** **Consistent attendance** is one of the most critical predictors of academic success.

---

### **3. Access to Learning Resources vs Exam Scores**
**Test Type:** ANOVA (Single Factor)  
**Groups:** Low (1), Medium (2), High (3)  
- **F-statistic:** 64.39  
- **p-value:** 2.52E-41  

**Interpretation:**  
The mean scores differ significantly across access levels:
- **Low:** 66.20  
- **Medium:** 67.13  
- **High:** 68.09  

✅ **Conclusion:** Students with **greater access to resources** perform better academically. Resource availability is a **high-impact factor**.

---

### **4. Internet Access vs Exam Scores**
**Test Type:** t-Test (Two-Sample Assuming Unequal Variances)  
- **Mean (Access):** 67.29  
- **Mean (No Access):** 66.54  
- **t-statistic:** 3.97  
- **p-value (two-tail):** 8.14E-05  

**Interpretation:**  
Students with internet access significantly outperform those without.  
✅ **Conclusion:** **Internet availability** has a **highly significant positive impact** on academic achievement.

---

### **5. Teacher Quality vs Exam Scores**
**Test Type:** ANOVA (Single Factor)  
**Groups:** Low (1), Medium (2), High (3)  
- **F-statistic:** 17.42  
- **p-value:** 2.91E-08  

**Interpretation:**  
Performance increases with teacher quality, indicating that **teacher effectiveness directly contributes to better student outcomes**.  
✅ **Conclusion:** **Teacher quality** significantly enhances academic performance.

---

### **6. School Type (Public vs Private)**
**Test Type:** Linear Regression  
**Model:** `Exam_Score = 63.61 + 1.79(School_Type)`  
- **R²:** 0.219  
- **p-value:** 0.067  

**Interpretation:**  
Public school students performed slightly better (by about 1.79 points) than private school students, though the difference is **not statistically significant**.  
⚠️ **Conclusion:** **School type** has a **low-to-moderate impact**, suggesting other factors play a larger role.

---

### **7. Gender vs Exam Scores**
**Test Type:** Linear Regression  
**Model:** `Exam_Score = 67.29 - 0.075(Gender)`  
- **R²:** 0.000078  
- **p-value:** 0.472  

**Interpretation:**  
The effect of gender on exam scores is statistically insignificant. Both male and female students achieved similar results.  
❌ **Conclusion:** **Gender** has **no measurable impact** on academic performance.
